# Classification-Project-Predicting-Customer-Churn
This repository contains code and resources for analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company (Telco). The project aims to predict customer churn and understand the demographic composition of churned customers compared to non-churned customers.

Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical concern for telecommunications companies. Understanding the factors contributing to churn and developing predictive models can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and explores the demographic characteristics of churned customers compared to those who did not churn.

Dataset
The project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about Telco customers, including demographic variables, services subscribed, and churn status. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is available in the data directory.

Installation
Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
https://github.com/AlphaLock/Classification-Project-Predicting-Customer-Churn.git
Install the required dependencies:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure that you have the dataset file (telco_dataset.csv) in the data directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook telco_churn_analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis and generate the results.

Explore the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

Modify the notebook as needed, such as trying different models, feature selections, or hyperparameter tuning.

Results
The project provides the following key results:

Prediction of customer churn using machine learning models.
Evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) for each model.
Demographic composition of churned customers compared to non-churned customers.
Visualizations, including stacked bar charts, to present the results.
